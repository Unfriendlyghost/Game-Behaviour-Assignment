# Game-Behaviour-Assignment
Holds work used for my games behaviour assessment.


Controlls for the demo
w,a,s,d - move the player
shift - to sprint
space - jump (not needed but it's there)
left mouse button - shoot
q & e - for the pathfinding demo, these will move the walls that change the NavMesh Agents path.
